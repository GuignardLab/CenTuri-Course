    "Now that we have all we need, we have to first create this initial figure as we did previously, that is what we do in the lines `4` to `7` of this plot: we create the figure of our pattern at the first time-point.\n",

    "Then we need to create the function to update our image, not the figure itself (the function is named `update` in the next cell).\n",
    "This update function modifies our image with the data at the adequate time-point `t`.\n",
    "Note the coma at the end of the `return` statement. It is because multiple images/lines/scatter plots could be needed to be updated, in our case it is just one, it might not always be the case.\n",

    "Before creating our animation, because we do not want to display all our time-points (it would be too long) we need to reduce our original image, which is done in line `14`.\n",
