# Introduction to Python using Turing patterns

## 1. Introduction

**First of, within this course [this page](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) will be mentioned a lot. It is a really good (but a bit crude) source for informations and it is the official Python page so it is also quite accurate.**

### 1.1 Goal of this course

This course aim at teaching the basics of coding using reaction diffusion simulations as a support, more specifically the Turing patterns.
The mathematics or the biology behind the Turing patterns is not necessary but it might help to understand better what is happening behind the hood.

At the end of the course, we would like you to be able to write small pieces of code to do basic data analysis.
No computation level is required though it is good to keep in mind that at the time being, this notebook alone might not be enough: the teachers are still necessary (unfortunately?) to introduce the concepts and to help answering the potential questions.
