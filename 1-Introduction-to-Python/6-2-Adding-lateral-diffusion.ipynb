    "### 5.2 Adding lateral diffusion\n",
    "Now, we are going to start doing real 1D!\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that, up to now, we are able to have a row of cells that are acting next to each other but independently. We want to add to that the diffusion process of the Turing patterns: the $\\mu_a\\nabla^2 a$ and $\\mu_i\\nabla^2 i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We model the lateral diffusion for a given cell as simply as possible. The diffusion is a proportion (the parameters $\\mu_a$ and $\\mu_i$) of concentration that a cell receive from its direct neighbours minus what that cell gives to its neighbour, which is twice a given proportion of its own concentration (the proportion being $\\mu_a$ for the activator and $\\mu_i$ for the inhibitor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if $a_x$ is the activator concentration in the cell at the position $x$, we can formalise the previous sentence as follow:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_a\\nabla^2 a_x = \\mu_a \\frac{a_{x+\\delta x} + a_{x-\\delta x} - 2a_x}{\\delta x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, after diffusion for a given time $\\delta t$, the concentration $a_x$ is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_{x, t+\\delta t} = a_{x, t} + \\delta t\\mu_a\\nabla^2 a_{x,t} = a_{x,t} + \\delta t\\mu_a \\frac{a_{x+\\delta x, t} + a_{x-\\delta x, t} - 2a_{x, t}}{\\delta x}\n",

    "Now that we have explained the theory (which might look a bit scary at first glance), let's see how we can implement that in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we need to compute the concentration of $A$ and $I$ for each cell.\n",
    "The difference is that before it was only depending on what was in that cell, now it also depends on what was in the neighbouring cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before (no neighbourhood interaction), i:\n",

    "A[i, t] = A[i, t-1] + dt * (mu_a*(A[i-1, t-1] + A[i+1, t-1] - 2*A[i, t-1]) +\\\n",

    "                                A[i, t-1] - I[i, t-1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What it means in practice is that, to compute the concentration of the activator or the inhibitor for a given cell, not only we need to know what was happening at the previous time in that cell but we also need to know what was happening in the neighbouring cells."
