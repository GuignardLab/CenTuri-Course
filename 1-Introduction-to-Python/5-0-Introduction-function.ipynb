    "## 5. Introduction to functions\n",
    "---\n",
    "You have seen some functions previously, for example the functions `print`, `eval`, `input` or `range` for example which are `builtin` functions, functions that are \"in\" Python. You've also seen the functions `answer`, `hint`, `da_alone`, `da` or `di` which are function that have been imported (here via the commands `from Resources.UsefulFunctions import *` and `from Resources.Answers import answer, hint`)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that can be called at any time once defined. Functions are especially useful as you may have noticed, when you know that you will want to call a piece of code multiple times, maybe with different inputs. For example, you called the function `print` with many different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are extremely powerful and can be manipulated in an extremely precise way. You can find all about that [there](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, the main idea is that a function can be defined the following way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function returns the highest fibonacci\n",
    "    number which is lower than n.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        n (int): upper boundary for the fibonacci number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        (int): higher fibo number lower than n\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "```\n",
    "As explained, this function has to do with Fibonacci numbers (they are pretty cool, you can find out more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "```\n",
    "is the name of the function (`fib`) followed by the sequence of arguments of the function (here there is only one: `n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lines:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function returns the highest fibonacci\n",
    "    number which is lower than n.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        n (int): upper boundary for the fibonacci number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        (int): higher fibo number lower than n\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "are the description of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, there is the code of the function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally the last last line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "```\n",
    "which informs the program what the function will return.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the code below to define the function and to test it:"
