    "---\n",
    "**First of, within this course [this page](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) will be mentioned a lot. It is a really good (maybe a bit crude) source for information and it is the official Python page so it should also be quite accurate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moreover, if you would like to read more about python, you can find a good list of books about Python [there](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks) (not all of them are free).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are two free online books that could be worth reading to go further:**\n",
    "- **[IPython Cookbook, Second Edition (2018)](https://ipython-books.github.io/) In depth book about python. While the book is of general interest and definitely worth reading, [that](https://ipython-books.github.io/124-simulating-a-partial-differential-equation-reaction-diffusion-systems-and-turing-patterns/) part was especially helpful for this course**\n",
    "- **[From Python to Numpy](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/) Especially useful when wanting to use Numpy, which you should!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Goal of this course\n",
    "This course aim at teaching the basics of coding using reaction diffusion simulations as a support, more specifically the Turing patterns.\n",
    "The mathematics or the biology behind the Turing patterns is not necessary but it might help to understand better what is happening behind the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the course, we would like you to be able to write small pieces of code to do basic data analysis.\n",
    "No computation level is required though it is good to keep in mind that at the time being, this notebook alone might not be enough: the teachers are still necessary (unfortunately?) to introduce the concepts and to help answering the potential questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Turing patterns\n",
    "Now about Turing patterns, they were introduced by Alan Turing in the article [The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf).\n",
    "They will not been much discussed here but fill free to ask questions or to look over [there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important to keep in mind is that a Turing pattern is the result of the interaction between an activator and its inhibitor and their co-diffusion across a set of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this interaction and diffusion that we will model in this course. We will also learn how to represent these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A little bit of knowledge about how to model these interactions is necessary to better understand the remaining of the course.\n",
    "First, we will be talking about an activator that will name $A$ and an inhibitor that will name $I$. Their concentration values will be refered to as $a$ and $i$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gene regulation network that we are considering here is the simple one where $A$ auto-activates and activates $I$ and $I$ inhibits $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/GRN.png\" alt=\"Gene Regulation Network\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> _**To go a little bit further (not required):**_\n",
    "> \n",
    "> From this network, we can extrat the interaction between activator $A$ and an inhibitor $I$ as follow:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $A \\rightarrow A$ ($A$ is auto activated)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $A \\rightarrow I$ ($A$ activates $I$)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $I \\dashv A$ ($I$ inhibits $A$)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> These interactions can be modeled multiple ways.\n",
    "> We decided here to use the [FitzHugh–Nagumo model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model) (for no particular reason) resulting in the following equations:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $\\frac{\\delta a}{\\delta t} = d_a\\Delta a + a - a^3 - i + k$ [1]\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $\\tau \\frac{\\delta i}{\\delta t} = d_i\\Delta i + a - i$ [2]\n",
    "> \n",
    "> These are partial differential equations that represent the change of concentration of $A$ ($\\delta a$) or $I$ ($\\delta i$) in time.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In equation [1], $\\Delta a$ is the potential diffusion $A$ and $d_a$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n",
    "> $+ a$ is the auto-activation of $A$, $-a^3$ is the degradation, $-i$ is the inhibition from $I$ and $k$ is a constant to determine whether $A$ acts as a source ($0<k$), a sink ($k<0$) or is neutral.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In equation [2], $\\Delta i$ is the potential diffusion of $I$ and $d_i$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n",
    "> $+a$ is the activation from $A$, $-i$ is the degradation and $\\tau$ allows to modulate the amplitude of change of concentration of $I$ compared to the one of the activator $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to know that to model the previous network it is necessary to decide on some values, the parameters of the model:\n",
    "- the diffusion coefficients $d_a$ and $d_i$ (refered to as `d_a` and `d_i` in the code)\n",
    "- the constant $\\tau$ (refered to as `tau`)\n",
    "- the constant $k$ (refered to as `k`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we will solve the differential equations numerically (as opposed to analytically) using simple numerical models, we will fix the value of $\\delta t$. Therefore:\n",
    "- $\\delta t$ is a parameter (refered to as `dt`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover other values are necessary for the computation also need to be decided:\n",
    "- the size of the grid we will be working on (`size`)\n",
    "- the distance between two cells (ie the space step: `dx` and `dy`)\n",
    "- the total time of the simulation (`T`)\n",
    "- the number of iterations (`n`, which is determined by the ratio of `T` over `dt`)"

You've also seen the functions `anwser`, `hint`, `da_alone`, `da` or `di` which are function that have been imported (here via the commands `from Resources.UsefulFunctions import *` and `from Resources.Answers import answer, hint`)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that can be called at any time once defined. Functions are especially useful as you may have notice, when you know that you will want to call a piece of code multiple times, maybe with different inputs. For example, you called the function `print` with many different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are extremely powerful and can be manipulated in an extremely precise way. You can find all about that [there](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, the main idea is that a function can be defined the following way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function returns the highest fibonacci\n",
    "    number which is lower than n.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        n (int): upper boundary for the fibonacci number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        (int): higher fibo number lower than n\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "```\n",
    "As explained, this function has to do with Fibonacci numbers (they are pretty cool, you can find out more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "```\n",
    "is the name of the function (`fib`) followed by the sequence of arguments of the function (here there is only one: `n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lines:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function returns the highest fibonacci\n",
    "    number which is lower than n.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        n (int): upper boundary for the fibonacci number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        (int): higher fibo number lower than n\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "are the description of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, there is the code of the function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally the last last line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "```\n",
    "which informs the program what will the function return.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the code bellow to define the function and to test it:"
