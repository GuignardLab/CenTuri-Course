    "A little bit of knowledge about how to model these interactions is necessary to better understand the remaining of the course.\n",

    "### 1.3 Coding in Python\n",
    "The goal of this course is for you to learn the basics of __coding__ in __Python__, but what does that really mean, or more specifically, what do we (the \"teachers\") mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.1 What is coding?\n",
    "Coding is giving a set of instructions to a computer for it to do a task.\n",
    "The tasks can be as trivial as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Give the result of 1 + 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "or, slightly more complex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the key 'a' from the keyboard is stroke, display the letter 'a' on the screen\n",
    "```\n",
    "or quite complex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Help proving the 4-color theorem\n",
    "```\n",
    "(see [Computer-assisted proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.2 Progammation language\n",
    "To communicate and give instructions to a computer and mainly the Computer Processing Unit (CPU), it is necessary to write the said instructions in a language that the CPU can indeed understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple types and sub-types of languages but here are two (maybe) main ones:\n",
    "- assembly language (specific to each CPU)\n",
    "- coding languages that will use compilers or interpreters to transform the “common language accross operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux, ...)” an assembly language that the CPU can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different coding languages: C++, Visual Basic, Java, R, Go, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we will use Python as our language of choice.\n",
    "This choice that was mainly driven by three reasons:\n",
    "- it is the language that I and many other teachers of this class are most confortable with\n",
    "- it is an opensource language\n",
    "- it is probably the opensource language that is today the most used in biology and datascience\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.3 What computers are good and not so good at\n",
    "Computers have strengths and weaknesses. They are especially good at:\n",
    "- performing basic operations: additions, multiplications, ...\n",
    "- accessing their short and long term memory\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, current common processors are working at $2.5GHz\\simeq 2.5\\times 10^9$ actions per second, meaning that if you would perform 1 action every second it would take you about 800 years to perform as many actions as a computer is doing in one second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are also good at storing information and accessing it.\n",
    "Computers can store about 1TB of data in slow-to-access memory and about 32GB of data in fast access memory (RAM).\n",
    "To put that in context, 1 hour of Netflix movie in HD weights about 3GB, so 3TB is 1000 hours of Netflix movie which is about 42 days of film.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, computers can access the data in memory quickly.\n",
    "Computers can read from 80 to 160MB per second, Solid State Drives (SSD) can read at a speed of 550MB per seconds.\n",
    "In other words, a computer can learn \"by heart\" the whole _A song of Ice and Fire_ series in about a second.\n",
    "Finally, Random Access Memory (RAM), which is the memory that directly exchange information with the CPUs read at a speed of about 1500MHz.\n",
    "(Note that for read/write intensive processes it can become a limiting factor for the overal processing speed)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, computers are not good at everything. For example, they are bad at:\n",
    "- Pattern recognition\n",
    "- Being creative (building hypothesis, making jokes, writting good novels, ...)\n",
    "- Anything that doesn’t have pre-existing data for\n",
    "\n",
    "Though, these limitations have been pushed significantly recently thanks to the artificial intelligence and deep learning revolution:\n",
    "- AlphaGO\n",
    "- Computers can now have intuition like behaviors that human can not understand\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.4 Learning a programming language\n",
    "Therefore, to code, you need to learn a programming language (here Python).\n",
    "Programming languages are all at least somewhat different and have specific rules but most of them rely on a common set of paradigms:\n",
    "- they have variables\n",
    "- they have datastructures (list, heaps, hashmaps, ...)\n",
    "- they have conditional statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to write some code, it is important to go through these basic and mostly common \"rules\""

    "## 4. Introduction to functions\n",
    "---\n",
    "You have seen some functions previously, for example the functions `print`, `eval`, `input` or `range` for example which are `builtin` functions, functions that are \"in\" Python. You've also seen the functions `anwser`, `hint`, `da_alone`, `da` or `di` which are function that have been imported (here via the commands `from Resources.UsefulFunctions import *` and `from Resources.Answers import answer, hint`)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that can be called at any time once defined. Functions are especially useful as you may have notice, when you know that you will want to call a piece of code multiple times, maybe with different inputs. For example, you called the function `print` with many different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are extremely powerful and can be manipulated in an extremely precise way. You can find all about that [there](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, the main idea is that a function can be defined the following way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function returns the highest fibonacci\n",
    "    number which is lower than n.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        n (int): upper boundary for the fibonacci number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        (int): higher fibo number lower than n\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "```\n",
    "As explained, this function has to do with Fibonacci numbers (they are pretty cool, you can find out more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "```\n",
    "is the name of the function (`fib`) followed by the sequence of arguments of the function (here there is only one: `n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lines:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function returns the highest fibonacci\n",
    "    number which is lower than n.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        n (int): upper boundary for the fibonacci number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        (int): higher fibo number lower than n\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "are the description of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, there is the code of the function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally the last last line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "```\n",
    "which informs the program what will the function return.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the code bellow to define the function and to test it:"

    "**This exercice is difficult, it might take a bit longer to solve. If you are stuck, don't hesitate to look at the following cells for some help**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercice, we will discuss about file manipulation, in other words how to move files automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention here! Proceed with caution for this exercice but also in general. Files removed using Python (or the shell for example) do not end up in the trash but are directly removed!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercice we would like to sort the files created in the previous exercice. We would like to group the plots generated previously in folders by values of `k` and so that the folder are named according to that `k` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you had the following files in your `exercice_7` folder:\n",
    "```\n",
    "exercice_7:\n",

    " | k2_tau0.png\n",
    " | k2_tau1.png\n",
    " | k2_tau2.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "We would like you to create the following hierarchy:\n",
    "```\n",
    "exercice_7:\n",
    " | k0:\n",
    "   | k0_tau0.png\n",
    "   | k0_tau1.png\n",

    "   | k2_tau1.png\n",
    "   | k2_tau2.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so you can use the following functions (assuming `p` is a `Path`):\n",
    "- `Path.iterdir` allows to loop through all the files of a directory\n",
    "- `p.name` retrieves the name of the file in `p` as a `str`\n",
    "- `str.split` splits a string\n",
    "- `Path.exists` see above\n",
    "- `p.rename` allows to rename (and therefore move) `p`\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not hesitate to look at the help of each of these functions (you should do it!)."

    "Now, we are going to start doing real 1D!\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that, up to now, we are able to have a row of cells that are acting next to each other but independently. We want to add to that the diffusion process of the Turing patterns: the $\\mu_a\\Delta a$ and $\\mu_i\\Delta i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We model the lateral diffusion for a given cell as simply as possible. The diffusion is a proportion (the parameters $\\mu_a$ and $\\mu_i$) of concentration that a cell recieve from its direct neighbors minus what that cell gives to its neighbor, which is twice the proportion $\\mu_a$ for that activator and $\\mu_i$ for the inhibitor of its own concentration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if $a_x$ is the activator concentration in the cell at the position $x$, we can formalize the previous sentence as follow:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_a\\Delta a_x = \\mu_a \\frac{a_{x+\\delta x} + a_{x-\\delta x} - 2a_x}{\\delta x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, after diffusion for a given time $\\delta t$, the concentration $a_x$ becomes is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_{x, t+\\delta t} = a_{x, t} + \\delta t\\mu_a\\Delta a_{x,t} = a_{x,t} + \\delta t\\mu_a \\frac{a_{x+\\delta x, t} + a_{x-\\delta x, t} - 2a_{x, t}}{\\delta x}\n",
