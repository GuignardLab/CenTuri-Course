    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "**First of, within this course [this page](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) will be mentioned a lot. It is a really good (maybe a bit crude) source for informations and it is the official Python page so it is also quite accurate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Goal of this course\n",
    "This course aim at teaching the basics of coding using reaction diffusion simulations as a support, more specifically the Turing patterns.\n",
    "The mathematics or the biology behind the Turing patterns is not necessary but it might help to understand better what is happening behind the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the course, we would like you to be able to write small pieces of code to do basic data analysis.\n",
    "No computation level is required though it is good to keep in mind that at the time being, this notebook alone might not be enough: the teachers are still necessary (unfortunately?) to introduce the concepts and to help answering the potential questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Turing patterns\n",
    "Now about Turing patterns, they were introduced by Alan Turing in the article [The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf).\n",
    "They will not been much discussed here but fill free to ask questions or to look over [there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important to keep in mind is that a Turing pattern is the result of the interaction between an activator and its inhibitor and their co-diffusion across a set of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this interaction and diffusion that we will model in this course. We will also learn how to represent these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A little bit of knowledge about how to model these interactions is necessary to better understand the remaining of the course.\n",
    "First, we will be talking about an activator that will name $A$ and an inhibitor that will name $I$. Their concentration values will be refered to as $a$ and $i$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gene regulation network that we are considering here is the simple one where $A$ auto-activates and activates $I$ and $I$ inhibits $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/GRN.png\" alt=\"Gene Regulation Network\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> _**To go a little bit further (not required):**_\n",
    "> \n",
    "> From this network, we can extrat the interaction between activator $A$ and an inhibitor $I$ as follow:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $A \\rightarrow A$ ($A$ is auto activated)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $A \\rightarrow I$ ($A$ activates $I$)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $I \\dashv A$ ($I$ inhibits $A$)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> These interactions can be modeled multiple ways.\n",
    "> We decided here to use the [FitzHugh–Nagumo model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model) (for no particular reason) resulting in the following equations:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $\\frac{\\delta a}{\\delta t} = d_a\\Delta a + a - a^3 - i + k$ [1]\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $\\tau \\frac{\\delta i}{\\delta t} = d_i\\Delta i + a - i$ [2]\n",
    "> \n",
    "> These are partial differential equations that represent the change of concentration of $A$ ($\\delta a$) or $I$ ($\\delta i$) when the time changes by a small amount ($\\delta t$).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In equation [1], $\\Delta a$ is the potential diffusion $A$ and $d_a$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n",
    "> $+ a$ is the auto-activation of $A$, $-a^3$ is the degradation, $-i$ is the inhibition from $I$ and $k$ is a constant.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In equation [2], $\\Delta i$ is the potential diffusion of $I$ and $d_i$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n",
    "> $+a$ is the activation from $A$ and $-i$ is the degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to know that to model the previous network it is necessary to decide on some values, the parameters of the model:\n",
    "- the diffusion coefficients $d_a$ and $d_i$ (refered to as `d_a` and `d_i` in the code)\n",
    "- the constant $\\tau$ (refered to as `tau`)\n",
    "- the constant $k$ (refered to as `k`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover other values are necessary for the computation also need to be decided:\n",
    "- the size of the grid we will be working on (`size`)\n",
    "- the distance between two cells (ie the space step: `dx` and `dy`)\n",
    "- the total time of the simulation (`T`)\n",
    "- the time step for the simulation (`dt`)\n",
    "- the number of iterations (`n`, which is determined by the ratio of `T` over `dt`)"

    "You have seen some functions previously, for example the functions `print`, `eval`, `input` or `range` for example which are `builtin` functions, functions that are \"in\" Python. You've also seen the functions `anwser`, `hint`, `da_alone`, `da` or `di` which are function that have been imported (here via the commands `from Resources.UsefulFunctions import *` and `from Resources.Answers import answer, hint`)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that can be called at any time once defined. Functions are especially useful as you may have notice, when you know that you will want to call a piece of code multiple times, maybe with different inputs. For example, you called the function `print` with many different inputs.\n",

    "Functions are extremely powerful and can be manipulated in an extremely precise way. You can find all about that [there](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, the main idea is that a function can be defined the following way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function returns the highest fibonacci\n",
    "    number which is lower than n.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        n (int): upper boundary for the fibonacci number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        (int): higher fibo number lower than n\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "```\n",
    "As explained, this function has to do with Fibonacci numbers (they are pretty cool, you can find out more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "```\n",
    "is the name of the function (`fib`) followed by the sequence of arguments of the function (here there is only one: `n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lines:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function returns the highest fibonacci\n",
    "    number which is lower than n.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        n (int): upper boundary for the fibonacci number\n",

    "        (int): higher fibo number lower than n\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "are the description of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, there is the code of the function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while b < n:\n",
    "        a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally the last last line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "```\n",
    "which informs the program what will the function return.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the code bellow to define the function and to test it:"

    "### Exercice 7\n",
    "**(With an intermezzo about file manipulation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can play with the different parameters to see how the concentration dynamics change according to these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we would like you to systematically try different parameters and save the produced plots as png files with names containing the parameter values (for example `'test_a0.4_i0.15_dt0.001_k-0.005_tau0.1.png'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To save the produced plots, you can use the argument `save_path` of the function `plot_concentration_1cell`.\n",
    "If you set its value to the file name and path you want to create, it will save it there under its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to do so, you might need some information about how to manipulate strings.\n",
    "In the previous exercices you might have seen that it is possible to insert values from variables within a string using the curved brackets `{` and `}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply putted, the way it works is by putting the character `f` before your string and then everything within curved brackets will be transformed in string if possible.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f'test_a{A[0]}_i{I[0]}_dt{dt}'\n",
    "```\n",
    "will produce the following string:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'test_a0.4_i0.15_dt0.001'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that if the `f` is not in front of the string, the curved brackets will be interpreted as normal characters.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Avoiding cramping up you current folder\n",
    "If you want to be a little bit cleaner, you can create a folder in which you will save your images.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create such a folder directly in python using `Path` from the `pathlib` library and the command:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Path.mkdir('<folder_name>')\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example, to crate a folder named `question_6` one could run the command\n",

    "```\n",
